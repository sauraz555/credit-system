"""SQLAlchemy ORM Data Models for the Credit Reporting Mechanism Platform.

This module defines the relational database schema and persistence models across the
entire credit reporting lifecycle, including user authentication, credit provider licensing,
legal entity representation, bitemporal credit ledgering, feature storage, model governance,
scoring outputs, credit enquiry tracking, statutory disputes, and immutable audit logs.

Architecture Tier:
    Data Layer / ORM (SQLAlchemy Declarative Models).

Key Dependencies & Callers:
    - Depends on SQLAlchemy 2.x declarative mapping.
    - Consumed by `backend/app/database.py` (engine & sessions), all API routers (`admin`,
      `auth_router`, `disputes`, `ingest`, `reports`), background tasks (`tasks.py`),
      and analytical services (`scoring.py`, `features.py`).

Regulatory & Compliance Context:
    - Individual Privacy Act 2018 (वैयक्तिक गोपनीयता सम्बन्धी ऐन, २०७५):
      Enforces personal data protection, consent mechanisms, subject access rights,
      and statutory dispute correction workflows.
    - Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB) Credit Information Directives:
      Governs credit information reporting, Blacklist (कालोसूची) criteria, and
      mandatory reporting eligibility across regulated Bank and Financial Institutions (BFIs).
